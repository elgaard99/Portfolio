  After high school I moved to Verona, Italy, to ride as a professional cyclist, and later in 2021 to Bourg-en-Bresse, France.
  This was a natural progression in my career, as I have been cycling since I was very young, which has given me many soft skills.
  Training +18 hours a week and frequently racing both domestically and internationally while completing my studies
  made me focused and good at managing my time. Riding on international teams with riders from around the world
  also made me independent, good at interacting with others, and quick to become part of a team.

  Alongside my own studies, I am part of an online study cafÃ© for students in their second semester.
  This is to help them, but also to practice communicating technical material and to put my thought process into words.

  In 2024 I started the online AP Graduate in Computer Science program at UCL in Odense (Denmark), while racing my final season as a professional.
  The online program has suited me well, as it allows flexibility in planning my time and where I work.
  There has also been a strong focus on independent work.
