  As part of my education as a Computer Science student, I am required to complete an internship, and I am therefore looking for a relevant company or organization to join.
  The internship should prepare me for a job as a Computer Science graduate and provide me with relevant work experience.
  
  I will participate like other newly hired employees with tasks, adherence to agreements, and follow-up on my work. It is not necessary for me to have a dedicated mentor or supervisor, as I am able to work independently, and this is the final part of my education.
  
  Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions ðŸ™‚
