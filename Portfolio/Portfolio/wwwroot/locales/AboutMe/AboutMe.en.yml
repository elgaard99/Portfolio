  After cycling my entire life and being a professional for a number of years in Italy and France, I have now chosen
  to focus on software development and IT management. In early 2024, I started an online 
  computer science program, where I have gained skills in C#, SQL, HTML, WPF, DevOps, DevSecOps, 
  networking, cloud computing, and project management.

  Even as a young child, I started playing with an Arduino and coding a little HTML and Python,
  because I love the endless possibilities that IT offers. I also love learning 
  new skills, and the constant development of the IT world appeals to me.

  When I'm not sitting in front of the computer, I love being active and getting out into 
  nature, whether it's cycling, running, or skiing. I also love seeing new places 
  and experiencing new cultures, so I try to travel as often as I can. But I also appreciate 
  slowing down with a good book or spending time with my friends over food, drinks, or board games.
